    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003.
       Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.
       Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station.
       He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.
       In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. 
       Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.
       In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania.
       He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics.
       However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995.
        Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.</p>
